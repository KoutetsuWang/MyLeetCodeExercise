# 450. Delete Node in a BST



Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return *the **root node reference** (possibly updated) of the BST*.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/04/del_node_1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- Each node has a **unique** value.
- `root` is a valid binary search tree.
- `-105 <= key <= 105`

 

**Follow up:** Could you solve it with time complexity `O(height of tree)`?



## Solution:

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

            root.right = delete(root.right,tmp.val);
        }
        return root;
