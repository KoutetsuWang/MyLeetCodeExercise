# 142. Linked List Cycle II



Given the `head` of a linked list, return *the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return* `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

 

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?



## Solution:

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
 
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        /*
        Two Pointers

        */
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
            // When two pointers meet, there must be a cycle existing
            if (fast == slow) {
                // Let two new pointers start from previous meeting node and the head node at the same pace.
                // When they meet, the new meeting node would be the entry node of the cycle.
                ListNode pointer1 = fast;
                ListNode pointer2 = head;
                while (pointer1 != pointer2) {
                    pointer1 = pointer1.next;
                    pointer2 = pointer2.next;
                }
                return pointer1; // Or pointer2, which is the same
            }
        }
        
        // Pointer hits null (tail) â†’ No cycle found
        return null;
    }
}
