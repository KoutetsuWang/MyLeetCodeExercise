# 792. Number of Matching Subsequences

Given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`, return *the number of* `words[i]` *that is a subsequence of* `s`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
- `s` and `words[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.



## Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numMatchingSubseq(String s, String[] words) {
        /*
        Bucket
        */
        
        /*
        The word bucket should be ordered by first letter like:
            buckets = {
                'a': ["a", "acd", "ace"],
                'b': ["bb"],
            }
        */
        List<String>[] buckets = new List[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < buckets.length; i++) {
            buckets[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        // Insert word into bucket based on their first letter index
        for (String word : words) {
            buckets[word.charAt(0) - 'a'].add(word);
        }
        
        int ans = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            // Check if there is a sub string starting at c matches any of the words in the bucket
            // If not founded, cur would be empty, and the loop would be skipped
            List<String> cur = new ArrayList<>(buckets[c - 'a']);
            buckets[c - 'a'].clear();
            for (String t : cur) {
                // If only 1 letter left, and it matched (if the code goes here)
                // We find the exact subsequence mathes. Answer count plus 1.
                if (t.length() == 1) {
                    ans++;
                // If length > 1, remove the starting letter (which we already find it matches if the code goes here)
                // And push the rest of the sub string back to the bucket (check later)
                } else {
                    buckets[t.charAt(1) - 'a'].add(t.substring(1));
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
