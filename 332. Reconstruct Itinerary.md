# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary



You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

- For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary2-graph.jpg)

```
Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= tickets.length <= 300`
- `tickets[i].length == 2`
- `fromi.length == 3`
- `toi.length == 3`
- `fromi` and `toi` consist of uppercase English letters.
- `fromi != toi`



## Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    /*
    DFS + Back Tracking
    Time: O(n*2^n)
    Space: O(n)
    */
    private List<List<String>> tickets = new ArrayList<>();
    private LinkedList<String> res = new LinkedList<>();
    private LinkedList<String> path = new LinkedList<>();

    public List<String> findItinerary(List<List<String>> tickets) {
        this.tickets = tickets;
        // All paths start with JFK
        path.add("JFK");
        // Sort tickets to deal wtih the smallest lexical order problem
        Collections.sort(tickets, (a, b) -> a.get(1).compareTo(b.get(1)));
        // Every ticket should be used once and only once
        boolean[] used = new boolean[tickets.size()];

        backTracking(used);

        return res;
    }

    public boolean backTracking(boolean[] used) {
        if (path.size() == tickets.size() + 1) {
            res = new LinkedList(path);
            return true;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < tickets.size(); i++) {
            // If there could be an unused ticket leave for a new destination
            if (!used[i] && tickets.get(i).get(0).equals(path.getLast())) {
                path.add(tickets.get(i).get(1));
                used[i] = true;

                if (backTracking(used)) {
                    return true;
                }

                used[i] = false;
                path.removeLast();
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
