# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree



Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
- `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.



## Solution:

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    /*
    Recursion + Post Order Traversal
    Time: O(N)
    Space: O(N)
    */
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        // Recursion stop condition
        if (root == null || root == p || root == q)
            return root;

        // Post Order Traversal
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

        // Nothing found
        if (left == null && right == null) {
            return null;
        // One node found in the left subtree
        } else if (left != null && right == null) {
            return left;
        // One node found in the right subtree
        } else if (left == null && right != null) {
            return right;
        // Both nodes were found, return the lowest common ancestor (current node)
        } else {
            return root;
        }
    }
}
```
