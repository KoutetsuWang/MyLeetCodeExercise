# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return *this repeated number*.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.

 

**Follow up:**

- How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
- Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?



Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        /*
        Binary Search
        */
        int left = 1;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (left < right){
            // mid: the mid value of nums, since it is of range[1, n]
            int mid = (left + right) >> 1;
            int counter = 0;
            
            for (int num : nums){
                if(num <= mid)
                    counter ++;
            }
            
            // In this case, the duplicated num must be smaller than mid value
            if (counter > mid){
                right = mid;
            }
            // Otherwise, the duplicated num must be greater than mid value
            else{
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
}
```
