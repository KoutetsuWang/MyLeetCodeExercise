# 200. Number of Islands



Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.



## Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    /*
    DFS
    Time: O(M × N) where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns.
    Space: worst case O(M × N) in case that the grid map is filled with lands where DFS goes by M×N deep.
    */
    private char[][] grid;
    private int m;
    private int n;

    // Flood Fill Algorithm
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        m = grid.length;
        n = grid[0].length;
        this.grid = grid;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // Once there is a land found, traverse all the connected lands and mark 0 (visited)
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    dfs(i, j);
                    ans++;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private void dfs(int i, int j) {
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        int[] dirs = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1};
        for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
            int x = i + dirs[k];
            int y = j + dirs[k + 1];
            if (x >= 0 && x < m && y >= 0 && y < n && grid[x][y] == '1') {
                dfs(x, y);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
