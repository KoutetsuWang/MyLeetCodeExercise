# 376. Wiggle Subsequence



A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

- For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a **wiggle sequence** because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` alternate between positive and negative.
- In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

A **subsequence** is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of the longest **wiggle subsequence** of* `nums`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

 

**Follow up:** Could you solve this in `O(n)` time?



## Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    /*
    Greedy
    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(1)
    */
    public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length <= 1) {
            return nums.length;
        }

        int curDiff = 0;    // nums[i] - nums[i-1]
        int preDiff = 0;    // nums[i-1] - nums[i-2]
        int count = 1;      // Record length of wiggle subsequence

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            curDiff = nums[i] - nums[i-1];

            // curDiff == 0 not included in the if condition
            // since we actually skip the nums[i] with the same number as previous one
            if ((curDiff > 0 && preDiff <=0) || (curDiff < 0 && preDiff >= 0)) {
                preDiff = curDiff;
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
