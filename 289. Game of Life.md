# 289. Game of Life

According to [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return *the next state*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/26/grid1.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/26/grid2.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 25`
- `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
        // Relative coordinates of adjacent squares
        int[][] dirs = new int[][]{{0, -1}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {1, 1}, {1, -1}, {-1, 1}, {-1, -1}};
        
        // Traverse the whole board and set cells to different status
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int cnt = 0;
                for (int[] dir : dirs) {
                    // x, y : The coordinates of the eight adjacent squares
                    int x = i + dir[0], y = j + dir[1];
                    // Status board[x][y] == 2 : live cell comes died.
                    if (x >= 0 && x < m && y >= 0 && y < n && (board[x][y] == 1 || board[x][y] == 2)) {
                        cnt++;
                    }
                }
                if (board[i][j] == 1 && (cnt < 2 || cnt > 3)) {
                    board[i][j] = 2;
                } else if (board[i][j] == 0 && cnt == 3) {
                    // Status board[x][y] == 3 : died cell backs alive.
                    board[i][j] = 3;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Traverse and decide whether the cell is live or died according to its status
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                board[i][j] %= 2;
                // Status board[x][y] == 1 : cell alive
                // Status board[x][y] == 0 : cell died
            }
        }
    }
}
```
