# 1151. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together



Given a binary array `data`, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all `1`â€™s present in the array together in **any place** in the array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 3 ways to group all 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0] using 2 swaps.
[0,0,1,1,1] using 1 swap.
The minimum is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: data = [0,0,0,1,0]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there is only one 1 in the array, no swaps are needed.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible solution that uses 3 swaps is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= data.length <= 105`
- `data[i]` is either `0` or `1`.



## Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(int[] data) {
        /*
        Two Pointers
        Time: O(n)
        Space: O(1)

        */

        // Count the number of ones in data array
        int onesSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i ++) {
            onesSum += data[i];
        }

        int windowOnesCounter = 0, maxOnes = 0;
        int left = 0, right = 0;

        // Moving the sliding window and find the maximun possible number of ones in the sliding window
        while (right < data.length) {
            windowOnesCounter += data[right];
            right ++;
            // Removing the oldest element in the sliding window
            if (right - left > onesSum) {
                windowOnesCounter -= data[left];
                left ++;
            }
            maxOnes = Math.max(maxOnes, windowOnesCounter);
        }

        // For the window with the maximum possible number of ones, 
        // we only need to swap all the ones outside the windows to the inside to make them group together,
        // which would also requires the minimum number of swaps
        return onesSum - maxOnes;
    }
}
```
