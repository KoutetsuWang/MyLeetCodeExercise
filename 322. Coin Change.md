# 322. Coin Change

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return *the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount*. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 104`



## Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int coinLen = coins.length;
        // dp[i][j] : the least amount of coins picked from first i kinds to make up the amount of j
        int[][] dp = new int[coinLen + 1][amount + 1];
        
        // amount + 1 equals infinite number in this case
        for (int i = 0; i <= coinLen; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], amount + 1);
        }
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        
        for(int i = 1; i <= coinLen; i ++){
            int cur = coins[i - 1];
            for(int j = 0; j <= amount; j ++){
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                // For the current coin denomination, check if it could form a new combination with the least coins
                if(j >= cur){
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - cur] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[coinLen][amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[coinLen][amount];
    }
}
```
