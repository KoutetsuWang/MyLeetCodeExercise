# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node



You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/14/116_sample.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 212 - 1]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`



## Solution:

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node next;

    public Node() {}
    
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    public Node(int _val, Node _left, Node _right, Node _next) {
        val = _val;
        left = _left;
        right = _right;
        next = _next;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        /*

        if (root == null) {
            return root;
        }
        
        // Start with the root node. There are no next pointers that need to be set up on the first level
        Node head = root;
        
        // Once we reach the final level, we are done
        while (head.left != null) {
            
            // Iterate the linked list starting from the head node and using the next pointers, 
            // establish the corresponding links for the next level
            Node cur = head;
            
            while (cur != null) {
                
                // Connect left child to right child
                cur.left.next = cur.right;
                
                // If cur.next node exists, it means there would be another 'left child' on the right of current 'right child'
                // Connect the right child to the next left child
                if (cur.next != null) {
                    cur.right.next = cur.next.left;
                }
                
                // Progress along the list (nodes on the current level)
                cur = cur.next;
            }
            
            // Move onto the next level
            head = head.left;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
```
