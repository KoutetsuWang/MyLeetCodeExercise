# 695. Max Area of Island

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return *the maximum **area** of an island in* `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.



## Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    /*
    DFS
    */
    private int[][] grid;
    private int m;
    private int n;

    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        m = grid.length;
        n = grid[0].length;
        this.grid = grid;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    ans = Math.max(ans, dfs(i, j));
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    private int dfs(int i, int j) {
        // Set the already found cell to 0
        grid[i][j] = 0;
        // 4 directions dictionary. Nice trick
        int[] dirs = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1};
        int ans = 1;
        for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
            int x = i + dirs[k];
            int y = j + dirs[k + 1];
            if (x >= 0 && x < m && y >= 0 && y < n && grid[x][y] == 1) {
                ans += dfs(x, y);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
