# 881. Boats to Save People



You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an **infinite number of boats** where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most `limit`.

Return *the minimum number of boats to carry every given person*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 104`



## Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        /*
        Sort + Two Pointers
        Time: O(Nlog⁡N)
        Space: O(logN)
        */
        
        Arrays.sort(people);    // people array shoud be in increasing order
        int num = 0;
        int i = 0, j = people.length - 1;
        
        while (i <= j) {
            // 1 boat could carry at most 2 people
            // If the 'fattest' person could go with the 'thinnest' person without breaking the weight limitaion
            // Let them go together
            if (people[i] + people[j] <= limit) {
                i++;
            }
            // Otherwise let the the 'fattest' person goes along, since the boat could not carry any extra person
            j--;
            num++;
        }
        return num;
    }
}
```
