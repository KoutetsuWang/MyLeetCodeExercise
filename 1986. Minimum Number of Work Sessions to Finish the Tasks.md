# 1986. Minimum Number of Work Sessions to Finish the Tasks

There are `n` tasks assigned to you. The task times are represented as an integer array `tasks` of length `n`, where the `ith` task takes `tasks[i]` hours to finish. A **work session** is when you work for **at most** `sessionTime` consecutive hours and then take a break.

You should finish the given tasks in a way that satisfies the following conditions:

- If you start a task in a work session, you must complete it in the **same** work session.
- You can start a new task **immediately** after finishing the previous one.
- You may complete the tasks in **any order**.

Given `tasks` and `sessionTime`, return *the **minimum** number of **work sessions** needed to finish all the tasks following the conditions above.*

The tests are generated such that `sessionTime` is **greater** than or **equal** to the **maximum** element in `tasks[i]`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tasks = [1,2,3], sessionTime = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: You can finish the tasks in two work sessions.
- First work session: finish the first and the second tasks in 1 + 2 = 3 hours.
- Second work session: finish the third task in 3 hours.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tasks = [3,1,3,1,1], sessionTime = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: You can finish the tasks in two work sessions.
- First work session: finish all the tasks except the last one in 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 8 hours.
- Second work session: finish the last task in 1 hour.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: tasks = [1,2,3,4,5], sessionTime = 15
Output: 1
Explanation: You can finish all the tasks in one work session.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == tasks.length`
- `1 <= n <= 14`
- `1 <= tasks[i] <= 10`
- `max(tasks[i]) <= sessionTime <= 15`



## Solution:

- Let `dp(mask, remainTime)` be the minimum of work sessions needed to finish all the tasks represent by `mask` (where `i`th bit = 1 means tasks[i] need to proceed) with the `remainTime` we have for the current session.
- Then dp((1 << n) - 1, 0) would be our result
  - We use `mask` as `111...1111`, representing we need to process all `n` tasks.
  - We pass `remainTime = 0`, which means there is no remain time for the current session, and request to create a new session.



```java
class Solution {
    /*
    DP + BitMask + Recursion
    */
    
    private int n, sessionTime;
    private Integer[][] dp = new Integer[1<<14][15];    // dp size: [2 ^ 14][15]
    
    public int minSessions(int[] tasks, int sessionTime) {
        n = tasks.length;
        this.sessionTime = sessionTime;
        return schedulable(tasks, (1 << n) - 1, 0);     // (1 << n) - 1 == '111...111' (n bits)
    }
    
    // Recursion func to check if tasks could be scheduled in 1 session
    int schedulable(int[] tasks, int mask, int remainTime) {
        // If all tasks are done
        if (mask == 0)
            return 0;
        
        // If dp already exists
        if (dp[mask][remainTime] != null) 
            return dp[mask][remainTime];
        
        int ans = n;  // Maximum n work sessions
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++) {
            // If the i bit is 1 -> the i th task is left undone
            if (((mask >> i) & 1) == 1) {
                // Clear the i th bit (mark i th task done)
                int newMask = ~(1 << i) & mask;
                // If i th task could be insert into the current session,  consume current session
                if (tasks[i] <= remainTime) {
                    ans = Math.min(ans, schedulable(tasks, newMask, remainTime - tasks[i]));
                // If i th task could not be inserted (time slot not enough), request a new session
                } else {
                    ans = Math.min(ans, schedulable(tasks, newMask, sessionTime - tasks[i]) + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        dp[mask][remainTime] = ans;
        
        return dp[mask][remainTime];
    }
}
```
