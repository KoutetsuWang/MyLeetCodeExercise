# 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

Given an `n x n` `matrix` where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, return *the* `kth` *smallest element in the matrix*.

Note that it is the `kth` smallest element **in the sorted order**, not the `kth` **distinct** element.

You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than `O(n2)`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
Output: 13
Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
Output: -5
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109`
- All the rows and columns of `matrix` are **guaranteed** to be sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
- `1 <= k <= n2`

 

**Follow up:**

- Could you solve the problem with a constant memory (i.e., `O(1)` memory complexity)?
- Could you solve the problem in `O(n)` time complexity? The solution may be too advanced for an interview but you may find reading [this paper](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~andy/pubs/X+Y.pdf) fun.



## Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    /*
    Binary Search
    */
    public int kthSmallest(int[][] matrix, int k) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        int left = matrix[0][0], right = matrix[n - 1][n - 1];
        
        while (left < right) {
            // >> is arithmetic shift right, >>> is logical shift right.
            // Check: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2811319/difference-between-and
            int mid = (left + right) >> 1;
            
            if (countLessOrEqual(matrix, mid, k, n)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }

    private boolean countLessOrEqual(int[][] matrix, int mid, int k, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        int i = n - 1, j = 0;
        while (i >= 0 && j < n) {
            if (matrix[i][j] <= mid) {
                count += (i + 1);
                j++;
            } else {
                // Decrease column until matrix[i][j] <= mid, which means mid would be in column i
                i--;
            }
        }
        // If true, kth <= mid, value greater than mid is irrelevant, let right = mid (narrow right boundary)
        // If false, kth > mid, value smaller than mid is irrelevant, let left = mid + 1 (narrow left boundary)
        return count >= k;
    }
}
```
