# 820. Short Encoding of Words

A **valid encoding** of an array of `words` is any reference string `s` and array of indices `indices` such that:

- `words.length == indices.length`
- The reference string `s` ends with the `'#'` character.
- For each index `indices[i]`, the **substring** of `s` starting from `indices[i]` and up to (but not including) the next `'#'` character is equal to `words[i]`.

Given an array of `words`, return *the **length of the shortest reference string*** `s` *possible of any **valid encoding** of* `words`*.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
Output: 10
Explanation: A valid encoding would be s = "time#bell#" and indices = [0, 2, 5].
words[0] = "time", the substring of s starting from indices[0] = 0 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
words[1] = "me", the substring of s starting from indices[1] = 2 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
words[2] = "bell", the substring of s starting from indices[2] = 5 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["t"]
Output: 2
Explanation: A valid encoding would be s = "t#" and indices = [0].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 2000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 7`
- `words[i]` consists of only lowercase letters.



## Solution:

```java
/*
Prefix Tree (Trie) + DFS
*/

class Trie {
    Trie[] children = new Trie[26];
}

class Solution {
    public int minimumLengthEncoding(String[] words) {
        Trie root = new Trie();
        
        for (String w : words) {
            Trie cur = root;
            // Build multiple layers prefix tree for words array
            for (int i = w.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                int idx = w.charAt(i) - 'a';
                if (cur.children[idx] == null) {
                    cur.children[idx] = new Trie();
                }
                cur = cur.children[idx];
            }
        }
        
        // The root is regarded as layer 1 and actually contains no value
        // root.children[] contains the first letter of the word in word array, which is layer 2
        // That makes sense since every substring ends with a '#'
        // Therefore, the length of each encoded string = substring.length + 1
        return dfs(root, 1);
    }

    // DFS to search the amount of unique suffixes that trie has 
    private int dfs(Trie cur, int layer) {
        boolean isLeaf = true;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (cur.children[i] != null) {
                isLeaf = false;
                ans += dfs(cur.children[i], layer + 1);
            }
        }
        
        // If isLeaf, an unique suffix is found
        // The length of the corresponding encoded string = layer
        if (isLeaf) {
            ans += layer;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```
