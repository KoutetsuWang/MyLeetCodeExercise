# 692. Top K Frequent Words



Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *most frequent strings*.

Return the answer **sorted** by **the frequency** from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their **lexicographical order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 500`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `k` is in the range `[1, The number of **unique** words[i]]`

 

**Follow-up:** Could you solve it in `O(n log(k))` time and `O(n)` extra space?



## Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> topKFrequent(String[] words, int k) {
        /*
        HashMap + Min Heap
        Time: O(nlogk)
        */

        // Count words frequency and put them into the hashmap
        Map<String, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            count.put(word, count.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Min heap (in descending order)
        // Put word1 in front of word2 if:
        // 1. frequency of word1 is higher than word2
        // 2. With same frequcny, sort by dictionary order 
        PriorityQueue<String> heap = new PriorityQueue<>(
            // compareTo: return positive if word2 is greater than word1
            // 0 id equal
            // negative if smaller
            (word1, word2) -> count.get(word1).equals(count.get(word2)) ?
                word2.compareTo(word1) : count.get(word1) - count.get(word2)
        );

        // Get first k elements
        for (String key : count.keySet()) {
            heap.offer(key);
            if (heap.size() > k) {
                heap.poll();
            }
        }

        // Notice the output should be in descending order
        LinkedList<String> res = new LinkedList<>();
        while (!heap.isEmpty()) {
            res.addFirst(heap.poll());
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
